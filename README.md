# Wind-Farm-Maintenance-Using-Markovian-Analysis

Today, wind turbines are the largest rotating machines on earth. With the increasing scale and
sophistication of those massive structures, reliability and maintenance engineers have to be
extremely careful when planning maintenance operations for wind turbines. Important questions
include, when and how should we intervene and maintain a turbine so as to minimize the total
downtime and maximize profits from electricity generation, bearing in mind that “pre-mature
maintenance,” i.e. doing maintenance too early may be too costly due to the production losses
and system interruptions, while a “too delayed maintenance” increases the risk of major failures,
which, in turn, would require major repairs. Complicating the problem is the fact that many
modern-day turbines are placed in remote locations where wind is most favorable, including in
areas where turbines may not be accessible for sustained periods of time due to unsafe wave
heights (i.e. offshore wind turbines) or too strong wind speeds.

In this case study, our goal was to use Markovian Analysis to find an optimal maintenance
policy which maximizes total yearly profit. Excel was used for this project.
